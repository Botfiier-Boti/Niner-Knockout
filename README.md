# Niner Knockout

![LaunchGif(1)](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/b222de20-8f07-4893-992a-716f557f78b7)

Fighting game base similar to Smash Bros. 

This repo was created so that members of the UNCC Game Development Club can create their own characters and have a game that represents us as a club. It is also going to help everyone learn to work together and support each other to make the game as fun as possible. 

Our deadline for making characters will be April because, at the Niner Esports Lan Party, there will be a setup for our game. 

Feel free to fork the repo now if you like and just try to [Sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) often to keep up with the changes.
