## Contributing

Please use Pull requests when developing your character. See [Character Development](#character-development)

For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Installation

First, install [Unity](https://unity.com/download), then install Unity version 2022.3.16f1 or 2022.3.X to open this project.

If you plan on contributing do not simply clone this repo, make a fork so that you can use version control before ever making a pull request. 

That is, select "Fork" in the top right of the GitHub page to create a fork on your account. 

## Character Development

In this tutorial, I will use words that come from the unity manual [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html). Please reference this if you don't understand which part of the interface I am referring to. 

The only time you will ever make a pull request is when you are finalizing your character. Do not make pull requests unless you are satisfied with their current state and consider them "Complete" for the time being. 

First, follow the [Installation](#installation) to set up your unity project. 

Now that you've forked this repo you can begin making your character. 

Navigate to Assets/Characters and create a new folder using the name of your character.

![CreateCharacterFolder](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/92d44a4f-c7f2-4c37-9760-46b1c9d70e19)

Now, add your character folder to your "favorites" in the [Project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) so it's easier to access.

### Create Character Files

> [!NOTE]
  > All files created should be placed within your Character Folder. 

1. Create a "Moveset", by selecting Create -> Character -> Moveset
    - Moveset naming convention "MovesetCharacterName" (PascalCase).
    - The Moveset stores parameters for every attack.
    - You can find the list of attacks in the [Required Moves](#required-moves) table.

2. Create a "Icon", by selecting Create -> Character -> Icon
    - Icon naming convention "IconCharacterName" (PascalCase).
    - Contains a reference to your player prefab (we'll set that up later)
    - Contains settings for how to display your character in the "selection" menu.
    - Contains a reference for the image shown in the "selection" menu.

3. Copy (Ctrl+C) the CharacterBase.prefab (Assets/Characters/CharacterBase.prefab) and paste it in your Character Folder (Ctrl-V)
4. Rename the prefab to be your character's name (PascalCase)
5. If you haven't created animations/art for your character please follow [Art](#art) and then return here.

### Create Character Script

  1. Create a new file in your Character Folder called "CharacterName.cs" (replace CharacterName with your character's name).
    -Select Create -> C# Script

     ![CreateCharacterScript](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/0620e8c2-b996-4418-bcbf-eaaacd1835f6)
     
  2. Open the script in your preferred IDE (Visual Studios is recommended) either by double-clicking or right-clicking and selecting "open" 

  3. Change the class declaration so that it inherits from "Player" instead of "MonoBehavior"
     ![ChangeParent](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/8273ee47-eda9-4e3a-b171-5253e7074bad)

  > [!WARNING]
  > If you do not have your animations set up yet, then pause here. 
  > Follow the [Art](#art) section [LD REPLACE THIS WITH A DIRECT LINK TO SETTING UP THEIR CHARACTER PREFABS/ANIMATIONS.

  4. <details>

     <summary>Override base methods.</summary>

     ### Override base methods
     > This section is only for **attack** animations.
     > You shouldn't be manually calling any movement animations,
     > those are automatically called in [Player.cs](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/blob/4c597641987918cf219d85183b895e2a4fd8c756/Assets/Scripts/Player/Player.cs).

     > LD You should probably just not leave this here and instead just say that we'll return to the script later and then go into the prefab part.
     > Then, after making the prefab do the art.
     > Then, during the art you can include a section about this in the part where you implement animations. 
    
     You can override the base methods for all the attacks to call your animations.
     For Example:
     https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/blob/4c597641987918cf219d85183b895e2a4fd8c756/Assets/Characters/NormTheNiner/NormTheNiner.cs#L15-L19

     Always call the base attack method, as shown above, there is internal code that must be invoked for expected functionality.
     
     Try to follow how Norm's animations are called and copy his animator controller for your character.
        
     </details>

### Setup Character Prefab

> TODO:
> Write this so that they understand how to add their Character script to the prefab.
> Then, let them go into the art section, and in the art section show them how to
> set up their prefab to have their sprite and their animator/animations. 

## Art

> [!WARNING]
> In Unity you can do 2D animations in 2 ways:
> - Sprite-Based
> - 2D rig Based
> I made the animations for Norm the Niner using a 2D rig I made.
> If you attempt to use Layers with a sprite-based animation it won't work.
> You will have to make your animations by first making movement animations
> Then make attack animations.
> Then, for attacks that you can do while moving you'll have to make new animations
> that are copies of the movement animation combined with the attack animation.
> It's up to you to decide which attacks you can do when moving but typically
> most attacks are done when stationary and have different variations when moving.
> For now, just make your movement animations, then make your attack animations.
> Then we can discuss how to set up a more refined animator to match your sprite-based setup.

Inside your "Characters/CharacterName" folder create two folders named "Sprites" and "Animations".
Place your sprites/2D art into the sprites folder and add your animations to the "Animations" folder

> TODO:
> Write some collapsable sections about how to import art for different styles/sizes.
> For example, for pixel art you must have "Filter" set to "Point (No Filter)" for it
> to look like pixel art and not be blurry. 


### Setting up the character

1. At least have your character sprite made by this step.
    - Place your sprites into the "Characters/CharacterName/Sprites" Folder you made earlier.
    - Next, open your prefab.
    - Drag your Sprite onto the "Sprite Parent" object.
    - This creates a new child object which will be the object
    - you animate.
    - If you cannot see your sprite set the position to be (0, 0, 0).
   
   ![CreateSpriteInPrefab](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/b6fd92b6-5e7c-4b4f-9efd-af7597dbe2c8)

   
2. Setting up the animator

  > In this section go over how to make a copy of the NormTheNiner animator and
  > Replace the animations in it with their animations.    
  > You also have to make sure that they already have the character sprite
  > in the game and that it has animations already set up.

  - Copy (Ctrl+C) the NormTheNiner Animator Controller and Paste (Ctrl+V) it into your "Characters/CharacterName/Animations" Folder.
  ![CopyAnimator](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/0a63212b-afee-4379-87dc-c76238ea8f50)
  - Double-click to open the animator and replace the animation references with your animations.
    - if you don't have your movement animations set up yet then take some time to make them. Refer to [Required Base Layer Animations](#required-base-layer-animations)
  ![EditAnimator](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/e5a943a5-f8ef-4521-8c6b-8f24dce23746)
  - Open your prefab and add an animator component to your sprite, set the animation controller reference to be the animator controller you just created.
  ![AddAnimatorComponent](https://github.com/LDMONTY007/Niner-Knockout/assets/69697953/46d59fdb-c8a9-4ffe-b681-4a31433df54b)
