## Contributing

Please use Pull requests when developing your character. See [Character Development](#character-development)

For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Installation

First, install [Unity](https://unity.com/download), then install Unity version 2022.3.16f1 or 2022.3.X to open this project.

If you plan on contributing do not simply clone this repo, make a fork so that you can use version control before ever making a pull request. 

That is, select "Fork" in the top right of the GitHub page to create a fork on your account. 

## Character Development

In this tutorial, I will use words that come from the unity manual [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html). Please reference this if you don't understand which part of the interface I am referring to. 

The only time you will ever make a pull request is when you are finalizing your character. Do not make pull requests unless you are satisfied with their current state and consider them "Complete" for the time being. 

First, follow the [Installation](#installation) to set up your unity project. 

Now that you've forked this repo you can begin making your character. 

Navigate to Assets/Characters and create a new folder using the name of your character.

-Insert images and how to create a character folder here-

Now, add your character folder to your "favorites" in the [Project window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) so it's easier to access.
